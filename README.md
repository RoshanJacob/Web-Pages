# Web-Pages

Hello! Welcome to this repository!

This website is designed to give a small introduction to HTML, through HTML, CSS, and Javascript (Plain and JQuery) 

There are different fonts ( Google fonts ), images (Unsplash and other sources), and styling used to create a parallax effect.

A unlinked sticky menu is present, which is still in development.

If you have any suggestions / improvements, please create a new issue!

(P.S - This is a website that is severely anti-mobile, so desktop viewing is recommended)
